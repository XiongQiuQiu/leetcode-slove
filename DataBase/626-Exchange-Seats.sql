-- Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.
--
-- The column id is continuous increment.
-- Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
-- Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?
-- +---------+---------+
-- |    id   | student |
-- +---------+---------+
-- |    1    | Abbot   |
-- |    2    | Doris   |
-- |    3    | Emerson |
-- |    4    | Green   |
-- |    5    | Jeames  |
-- +---------+---------+
-- For the sample input, the output is:
-- +---------+---------+
-- |    id   | student |
-- +---------+---------+
-- |    1    | Doris   |
-- |    2    | Abbot   |
-- |    3    | Green   |
-- |    4    | Emerson |
-- |    5    | Jeames  |
-- +---------+---------+
-- Note:
-- If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.
