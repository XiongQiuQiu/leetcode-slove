'''
The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \
     3   1
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
Example 2:
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \
 1   3   1
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

Let

f1(node) be the value of maximum money we can rob from the subtree with node as root ( we can rob node if necessary).

f2(node) be the value of maximum money we can rob from the subtree with node as root but without robbing node.

Then we have

f2(node) = f1(node.left) + f1(node.right) and

f1(node) = max( f2(node.left)+f2(node.right)+node.value, f2(node) ).
